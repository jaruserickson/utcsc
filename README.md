vanillaJS based website for my schools Counter-Strike Club.
  
# Source
  Tabletop.js  
  Bootstrap 3  
  jQuery 3.1  


The site's intramural data is reading straight from google sheets for ease of use. This was done with Tabletop.js and a bunch of vanillaJS.
  
jQuery and Bootstrap hold the styling together for the most part.
